oneup - Online Networked Environment for Unix Products.

Really this is just some [[http://ansible.cc][Ansible]] files for installing packages from
source in a manner that is compatible with [[http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/][UPS]].

High-level configuration is in a =host_vars/<host>= file.  Each "host"
defines a list of packages to build and their versions.  It defines a
platform "flavor" label to use that describes the build host.  It can
also define some special keyword qualifiers that may influence the
build and a "variant" label used with the flavor to produce a uniquely
named install directory.  You can also set:

 - real name for build host
 - base source cache, temp build and install directories
 - the =proxy_env= variable if HTTP proxy is required from build host
 - any build qualifiers and a corresponding variant name
 - the =products= list giving packages and versions
