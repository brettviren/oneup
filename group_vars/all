# Define variables for a product.  
#
# They are based on variables defined else where:
#
# The host_vars/ file must define: "products"
#
# The products/ file must define "pkg", "srcdir" and "tarball".  
#
# In addition, some variables are gathered as facts.

# A platform specific label
flavor: ${ansible_system}+${ansible_distribution}${ansible_distribution_version}

# The package's native version string 
version: ${products.${pkg}.version}

# A uniquely named sub-directory based on platform and package version
unique: ${version}/${flavor}

# The full path to the source tarball
tar_file: ${source_cache}/${tarball}

# The full path to the base of the package's build area
build_path: ${build_base}/${pkg}/${unique}

# The full path to the base of the package's unpacked source 
source_path: ${build_path}/${srcdir}

# The full path to the base where the compiled package is installed
install_path: ${install_base}/${pkg}/${unique}
